# Starsy

**Random Star System Generator**

**Feel free to try it right away at [starsy.netlify.app](https://starsy.netlify.app)**


## State of implementation

The application is working but certain features are missing or unpolished:

✅ Visualization of the Star System

✅ ~Multiple~~Themes~ Full theming support

✅ Manipulation of objects by value

✅ Interactive value change (drag'n'drop / scroll)

✅ Objects can be removed

✅ Last removed object (planet) can be restored

✅ add new planets and satellites

✅ Export data / Import data

❌ randomly generate star system

❌ astroid belts

❌ Export graphic via print or PDF


Missing features above are all planned for 0.5 release version. Future versions might get some or all of the following features:

⁉ More fonts and themes

⁉ Add meta data to any object

⁉ Export a single- or multi-page report / dossier / pamphlet

⁉ More object types (stations orbiting the star, mega structures?)

⁉ (faction?) Icons for planets / moons / stations

⁉ ...possibly more to come, let me know about your ideas!
